## Examining the Central Limit Theorem in Poisson and Chi-Square Distributions

## 1) Poisson distribution with parameter 2

As shown in the graphs below, in the case of 200 repetitions, the histogram is relatively spread out because the number of repetitions is low, and the distribution of the means is not yet fully normal.

In the second case, with 2000 repetitions, the histogram becomes more bell-shaped compared to the first case. The fluctuations are smaller, and the overall shape is closer to a normal distribution.

In the third case, with 20000 repetitions, the histogram becomes completely symmetric and bell-shaped, clearly resembling a normal distributionâ€”exactly what the Central Limit Theorem predicts.

## Chi-Square Distribution with 10 Degrees of Freedom

In the first case, with 200 repetitions, the histogram is relatively uneven, and the number of repetitions is low, so the sample mean has not yet approached normality.

In the second case, with 2000 repetitions, the histogram has become slightly more symmetric, and the normal curve fits the data better.

In the third case, with 20000 repetitions, we can see that there are many sample means, and the histogram has become almost normal in shape, thus confirming the Central Limit Theorem.
